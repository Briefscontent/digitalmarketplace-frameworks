question: Cultural fit criteria
question_advice: |
  Cultural fit is about how well you and the supplier work together.

  #Cultural fit is how suppliers:

  - work with other people
  - solve problems
  - make decisions
  - share knowledge and experience
  - deal with making mistakes

  #Cultural fit isn’t whether suppliers:

  - look, talk or behave in the same way as you
  - have agile skills – that’s technical competence

  #Giving points for individual criteria (optional)
  You can give points to individual criteria, eg ‘transparent and collaborative when making decisions – 15 points’. If you choose to add points, you must do it for all individual criteria.
