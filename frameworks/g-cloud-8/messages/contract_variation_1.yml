variation_description: |
    The Crown Commercial Service (CCS) proposes to make some minor changes to the framework agreement and call-off 
    contract (reference: RM1557viii-15-07-2016).
    
    These minor changes were agreed in the answers provided to suppliers while G-Cloud 8 applications were open. 
    The changes make it easier for suppliers to work with government and are listed here.
